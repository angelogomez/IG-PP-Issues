 I really love them. However, I’ve been looking for a tweak to prevent auto loading of stories from Instagram. I´m thinking in something that works like Snap + for Snapchat does.
 
 For those, like me, who have the ridiculous data caps/throttling, I would like a little more control over what is being loaded each time I open an app. For example, I don't need every story to load. It would be nice if they all had the tap to load option that way I could pick and choose whose story I'd like to see and when. It’d be great and awesome if you add this option for the Instagram ++
 
Thanks in advance!
